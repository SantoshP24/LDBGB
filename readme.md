# 🚀 LDGBG: Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation

## 📌 Overview
Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation (LDGBG) is a granular computing technique that partitions data into adaptive granular balls based on local density. It enhances robustness, interpretability, and classification performance compared to traditional instance-based learning methods.

## ✨ Features
- Local-density based granular-ball generation  
- Automatic ball splitting and refinement  
- Noise-resistant and scalable approach  
- Compatible with granular-ball classifiers (e.g., LDGBKNN)  

## 📊 Datasets
Breast Cancer, Dermatology, Diabetes, Sonar, Zoo, Seeds, Ionosphere, Mushroom.
