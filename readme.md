# 🚀 LDGBG: Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation
A **Python implementation of Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation (LDGBG)** for granular computing and classification research.

---

## 📌 Overview
LDGBG is a granular computing method that partitions data into adaptive granular balls using local density.  
It improves robustness, interpretability, and classification accuracy over traditional instance-based methods.

## ✨ Features
- Local-density based granular-ball generation  
- Automatic ball splitting & refinement  
- Noise-resistant and scalable  
- Supports multiple benchmark datasets  
- Integrated with **LDGBKNN** classifier
