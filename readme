# 🚀 LDGBG: Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation

**A concise Python implementation of Local-Density Granular-Ball Generation (LDGBG)** for granular computing and classification research.

---

## 📌 Overview

LDGBG is a granular computing technique that partitions data into adaptive granular balls based on local density. It improves robustness, interpretability, and classification performance compared to traditional instance-based methods.

---

## ✨ Features

* Local-density based granular-ball generation
* Automatic ball splitting and refinement
* Noise-resistant and scalable
* Supports multiple benchmark datasets
* Integrated with granular-ball classifiers (e.g., LDGBKNN)
